# Buzzlab

Buzzlab is an open source project from CESAR School that helps people find hardware components in nearby labs.

## Como funciona

Buzzlab allows users to search for specific components, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, and find nearby labs that have these components in stock. Users can then contact the labs to obtain the components.
